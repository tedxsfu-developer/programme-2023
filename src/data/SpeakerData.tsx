He uses diving and breathing to access his cultural, ancestral, and personal worlds while exploring memories of the Earth’s geological time deposited within the bodies of living algae. As Earth’s principal carbon sinks, algae produce approximatively 70% of planetary oxygen while consuming gasses produced by the burning of Earth’s geological layers (such as coal, oil and gas). Kanic graduated OCAD University as the Governor General’s Academic Medal and Sir Edmund Walker Award recipient along with Newcomer Arts Award, Artist Project Emerging Artist Award, and InterAccess Media Prize. His living sculptures have been exhibited throughout North America and featured on TEDx talk platform.",
